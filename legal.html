  <h1>Website Terms of Use</h1>

  <h2>1. Don’t Be an Asshole</h2>
  <p>
    By using this website, you agree not to engage in any conduct that’s harmful, hateful,
    harassing, defamatory, or otherwise just plain rude. Basically: treat people (and this site) with respect.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Messing With My Data (and I Won’t Mess With Yours)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Data Collection:</strong> I’m not here to gather a bunch of personal information about you.
    If the site does collect anything (like cookies for basic functionality), it’s only used
    to improve your experience or keep the site running smoothly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Your Info:</strong> Any info I do end up with (like an email you voluntarily provided) will be
    kept as safe as reasonably possible. I won’t sell, trade, or share it with random third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>My Stuff:</strong> Don’t try to hack, scrape, or otherwise break into my website or servers.
    It’s illegal, and it’s also a jerk move.
  </p>

  <h2>3. No Warranties</h2>
  <p>
    This site is provided “as is.” I don’t guarantee it’ll always be up, bug-free, or immune from digital gremlins.
    You agree to use it at your own risk.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    I’m not liable for any damages or losses you might incur through use of the site, including (but not limited to)
    direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    If I decide to update these terms, I’ll post the changes here. Your continued use of the site means you’re
    cool with the updated terms.
  </p>
